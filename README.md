# **Tetris Clone**

This is a clone of the classic Tetris game, developed for the Android platform using Java in Android Studio. The project simulates the traditional gameplay, where pieces fall onto a board, and the goal is to complete horizontal lines to increase the score.

## Features

- **Piece Movement**: Pieces automatically fall and can be moved left, right, or down.
- **Piece Rotation**: Each piece can be rotated to better fit the board.
- **Line Clearing**: When a row is completely filled, it is cleared, and the player scores points.
- **Scoring**: Points increase with each cleared line.
- **Random Piece Generation**: Pieces are generated randomly to mimic the original game behavior.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions, preventing pieces from overlapping or going beyond the board limits.

## Technologies Used
